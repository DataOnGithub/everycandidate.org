[Every Candidate](/) started as a personal itch back in 2008. It was inspired by a talk given by [Every Block](http://www.niemanlab.org/encyclo/everyblock) founder, [Adrian Holovaty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Holovaty), at the Online News Associations 2007 conference in Toronto that presented a systematic way for looking at stories about people, places, and events. Two years later, in the lead up to the 2010 Toronto municipal election -- at this point obsessed with the intersection of technology and journalism -- I had my hands full tying to get the Knight-Mozilla News Technology Partnership up-and-running and didn't have time to scratch that itch. Fast forward to 2014. I am no less busy, but I am twice as stubborn. I decided: now or never, let's get the minimum viable product out the door. Thanks for the herculean efforts of Tim Groves, my project partner and the "boots on the ground" at Toronto City Hall, here we are. I hope you find the experiment as interesting as I do.
