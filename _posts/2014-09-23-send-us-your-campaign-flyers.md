![Send Every Candidate your Toronto city council candidate campaign flyers](/assets/2014/09/flyers.jpg)

Here at Every Candidate we would really like to present you, our faithful readers, with a big, colourful map of the city's election candidates -- but we need your help to make it happen. Don't worry, we're not asking for money. 

It's a simple ask, in fact: you can help by just gathering up one of those campaign flyers that are probably accumulating in your mailbox or are on route to your recycling bin, snap a photo of it (front and back please), and <a href="mailto:everycandidate@gmail.com">send the photos to us</a>. We'll take it from there. 

We'll take those digital snapshots of the campaign flyers and upload them right onto each candidate's page here at Every Candidate. And, while we're doing that, we'll also add your name to our [hall of fame](/about/#contributors). 

Think about it: one-stop shopping for Toronto election campaign literature and zero (additional) waste. How amazing is that?

If we get enough campaign flyers, we'll stitch them together (digitally of course, because we're allergic to paper) to make an interesting visual thingamabob with them (yes, that's a technical term). More than just helping your neighbours and other Toronto residents, you'll be creating an art installation of epic proportions! That's a pretty big impact for <a href="mailto:everycandidate@gmail.com">just e-mailing us a photo or two</a>. 

So, what are you waiting for?
