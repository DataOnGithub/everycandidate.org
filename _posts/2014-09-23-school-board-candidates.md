Just a quick note to mention that we've posted the inital data for the [127 Toronto District School Board trustee candidates](/candidates/#toronto-school-board) that are running in Toronto's [22 school wards](/wards/#toronto-school-wards).

Don't get your hopes up just yet: the data provided by trustee candidates to the city is quite thin and we have yet to begin our research process on these candidates. 

It's a start. If you'd like to help out with the research, <a href="mailto:everycandidate@gmail.com">please get in touch</a>.
