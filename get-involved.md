title: Get Involved 
---

On the off-chance that it has not been said enough, there is a very, very small "[team](/about#team)" behind the Every Candidate project. It's a passion project. The work is done off the side of our desks. That's **great** news for you, because there is lots that needs attention and not a lot of hands to do the work.

Here are some simple ways you can get involved today (more will be added in the coming days):

* **Review the candidate data and fill in the gaps**: no web site for a candidate? Give them a call and ask about it! Then <a href="mailto:everycandidate@gmail.org">drop us a note</a>.

* **Send us a candidate's campaign flyer**: More will be posted about this soon, but -- in summary -- before throwing out those campaign flyers, take a quick snapshot with your phone or camera (front & back please!) and <a href="mailto:everycandidate@gmail.org">send them to us</a>.

* **Let us know about all-candidates debates in your ward**: If you know of an upcoming all-candidates debate in your ward, please <a href="mailto:everycandidate@gmail.org">drop us a note</a>. 

* **Come up with a great idea for how to make this site better**: Admittedly, we were long on intentions and short on time in building this site. Have an idea for a priority improvements, <a href="mailto:everycandidate@gmail.com">we'd be happy to hear it</a>.
