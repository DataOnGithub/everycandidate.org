The following table breaks down the [358 candidates for city council](/candidates/) and shows [how many are running in each of the 44 wards](/wards/). 

Some wards have only three or four candidates running, while 15 wards have 10 or more candidates in the race. [Ward 20, Trinity—Spadina,](/toronto-ward/trinity-spadina-20/) has 22 candidates contending for the seat. 

Incumbents are running for re-election in 84% of Toronto's wards. There are seven wards where no incumbent is running. The people elected in these seven wards could have a significant impact on the policies of Toronto's next city council. 

In the table below you can follow the links to examine the candidates for each ward in more detail.
